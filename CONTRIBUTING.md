# Contributing

Coding challenges are organized by job role and broken into challenges.

Speak with @WesRoach or @rileyschack about utilizing this project and/or contributing challenges.

We can help setup a separate repository if needed. We would prefer to maintain a single repository if possible. We're open to installing new dependencies as needed for your challenge (pre-configured databases, etc), as long as any new configuration will not break existing challenges.

If we realize that the docker builds are becoming too large or the environment too slow, we may separate the challenges into separate repositories to limit the build time and background processes running within the coding environment.
